<p>The mythology of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round table encompasses many stories. Below is a summary of one of the more famous tales, in which the magical scabbard of his sword is stolen.</p>

<hr>

<h4>The Main Characters</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Arthur, King of Britain</li>
	<li>Accolon, a Knight of the Round Table</li>
	<li>Urien, a King allied to Arthur</li>
	<li>Morgan Le Fay, wife of Urien, sister and rival of Arthur</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h4>Part 1</h4>

<p>The story begins with Arthur and his companions, the king Urien and the knight Accolon, on a hunt.</p>

<aside>Note that this summary is concerned, above all, with telling the most well known version of this story. There are indeed many ways to describe the characters and their motivations. Accolon, for example, has been portrayed in alternate tellings and fiction as both an ally of Morgan Le Fay, as well as her unwitting pawn. But such interpretations are beyond the scope of this website.</aside>
